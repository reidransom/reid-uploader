Hi Reid,

Here's the test. This is going to be a good deal of work, and should test your skills pretty well. Let's set the deadline to finish by the end of this week (Sunday).

1 - Set up a web page where I can upload a video. Here is the uploader you will need to integrate -- https://github.com/cinely/mule-uploader. It uses S3 as a backend. You'll need to set up an AWS account and S3 bucket if you don't already have one.

2 - I am going to upload these three videos: 

- https://s3.amazonaws.com/akiai-testing/Elegy_1080p+-+162.5+MB+-+2m12s.mov
- https://s3.amazonaws.com/akiai-testing/StormyCalifornia-Fire_Final.mov
- https://s3.amazonaws.com/akiai-testing/bite-size-animation.mov

3 - Transcode the videos into an iPhone-like profile (you can make up the profile, the specifics don't matter).

4 - On the website, you'll show a link to download the old video (not the link I sent above, but you'll store it wherever it's being uploaded to) and a link to download the new file. For each file, show the basic information:

- Frame rate
- Resolution
- # audio channels
- Length
- Bitrate
- Size

5 - Provide a website url and github repository for us to test the site and look over your code.

I know this will be a bit of work, but I'm very excited to see your background and I think you have a great resume and have written some nice and useful applications before. I'm very much looking forward to seeing what you can do with this.

Thanks,

David
